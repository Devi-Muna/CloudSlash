# CloudSlash v1.3.2: The "Future-Glass" Update

> **"Context is King."** — This release transforms CloudSlash from a CLI tool into a forensic console.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. The Interactive TUI (Terminal User Interface)
We've overhauled the interface with a "Future-Glass" aesthetic. No emojis. Just data.
- **Obsidian HUD**: Always-on visibility of your total waste and risk score.
- **Sparklines**: Visual metric history (`[__▂▄▇]`) right in the terminal.
- **Blame**: Automatically identifying *who* created the zombie resource.

### 2. Advanced Workflows
- **Blast Radius Check**: `nuke` now warns you if a resource has active dependents.
- **Soft Delete (`m`)**: Not ready to delete? Mark it for later.
- **Clipboard Ninja**: `y` to yank IDs, `shift+Y` for ARNs.
- **"Guilt Trip"**: See annualized costs (`$1,200/yr`) to see the true price of laziness.

### 3. Accountability
- **Paper Trail**: Every destructive action is logged to `~/.cloudslash/audit.log`.
