# CloudSlash v1.3.5: "The Derivative" (Signal Processing Update)

**Release Date:** Jan 09, 2026
**Update Type:** Feature Release (Local Engine Upgrade)

---

### 📉 From "Spending" to "Velocity"

Most cloud tools just tell you _where_ you are bleeding money.
**CloudSlash v1.3.5** now tells you _how fast_ the bleed is accelerating.

We have upgraded the core engine from a static scanner to a stateful **Signal Processing Unit**. By tracking the "Derivative" of your cost curve (Rate of Change over Time), we can now predict financial runway exhaustion before it happens.

### 🚀 New Features

#### 1. "Time-to-Bankrupt" (TTB) Prediction

Using 2nd-order calculus on your cost acceleration, CloudSlash now estimates exactly how long your current budget will last if the current spending velocity continues.

> _"💀 Critical Alert: Budget exhaustion predicted in 4 hours 12 minutes."_

#### 2. Vector Anomaly Detection

We now fingerprint the "shape" of your infrastructure spikes using vector embeddings and cosine similarity.

- **Safe Spike:** "Auto-Scaling Up" (Balanced growth of EC2 + ELB).
- **Anomaly Spike:** "Vertical Wall" (Sudden 400% increase in NAT Gateway cost with 0% increase in traffic).

#### 3. The Ledger (`~/.cloudslash/ledger.jsonl`)

Your scan history is now saved locally. CloudSlash builds a pharmacological memory of your infrastructure, allowing it to detect drift and regression over time. **No data ever leaves your machine.**

### 🛠️ How to Update

Since this is a Rolling Release, simply pull the latest binary or run the update command:

```bash
cloudslash update
```

_(Or build from source if you are customizing the heuristic engine)_.
