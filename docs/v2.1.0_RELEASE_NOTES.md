# v2.1.0 Enterprise Update

## Executive Summary

CloudSlash v2.1.0 delivers critical enhancements to the auditing engine, focusing on "Long-Term Artifact Management" and "Granular Exclusion Policies." This update allows enterprises to safely retain compliance-related backups while aggressively cleaning up true waste.

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Fossil AMI Detection

The Forensic Engine now identifies Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) that are:

- More than 90 days old.
- Have zero active instances.
- Are not tagged for retention.

### 2. Granular Ignore Policies

Users can now override heuristics with precision tagging policy using `cloudslash:ignore`.

- **Date-Based:** `cloudslash:ignore = 2027-01-01` (Ignore until date).
- **Duration-Based:** `cloudslash:ignore = 180d` (Ignore if age < 180 days).
- **Boolean:** `cloudslash:ignore = true` (Permanent exclusion).

### 3. Full-Spectrum Remediation

The Remediation Generator (`cleanup` command) now supports 100% of detected resource types.

- **New Support:** ELBs (Load Balancers), ECS Clusters, ECS Services, EKS Clusters, NodeGroups, ECR Repositories, Lambda Functions, and Log Groups.
- **Safety Fix:** Warning logic added for EBS `gp2` volumes (Modify vs Delete).

## Compliance & Safety

- **Audit Trails:** JSON reports now include precise "Audit Detail" reasons for all "Aged Artifacts."
- **Non-Destructive Defaults:** By default, AMIs are retained unless older than the 90-day threshold.
