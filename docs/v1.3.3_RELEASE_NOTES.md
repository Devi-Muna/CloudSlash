# CloudSlash v1.3.3 Release Notes

**License:** AGPLv3 (Open Source)
**Date:** January 06, 2026

## The Community-First Update

CloudSlash v1.3.3 marks a major pivot in our philosophy. We have removed all paywalls, license keys, and tiered feature restrictions. CloudSlash is now fully open-source (AGPLv3) and free for internal use.

### All Features Unlocked

Every advanced capability that was previously locked behind the "Pro" or "Enterprise" tier is now available to all users:

- **Headless Mode**: Run `cloudslash scan --headless` in your CI/CD pipelines without a license key.
- **The State Doctor**: Generate surgical `fix_terraform.sh` and `waste.tf` scripts to clean up your Terraform infrastructure.
- **Forensic Reports**: Generate full HTML Dashboards, detailed CSVs, and Executive Summaries.

### Support the Project

We build this tool to help you save money and secure your infrastructure. If you find CloudSlash valuable, please consider supporting us:

- **Star us on GitHub**: It helps us gain visibility.
- **Contribute**: PRs are welcome.

### Improvements

- **Performance**: Faster scanning via optimized concurrency.
- **Logic**: Improved heuristics for NAT Gateway and EIP analysis.
- **Legal**: New AGPLv3 license terms and exemptions policy clearly defined.
