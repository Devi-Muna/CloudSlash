# v2.0.0

**Release Date:** January 12, 2026

## Executive Summary

CloudSlash v2.0.0 introduces the **Autonomy Engine**, enabling automated infrastructure optimization via constraint-based solving and resource packing algorithms. This release also consolidates key governance capabilities including Provenance Attribution, Identity Resolution, and Non-Destructive Remediation.

## Key Capabilities

### Autonomy Engine

- **Optimization Solver:** Utilizes Mixed-Integer Linear Programming models to determine optimal instance fleet composition based on workload requirements and availability zone constraints.
- **Fragmentation Analysis:** Implements 2D Bin Packing algorithms to visualize and reduce cluster fragmentation.
- **Risk Assessment:** Incorporates Bayesian probability models to evaluate Spot Instance stability.

### Governance & Remediation

- **Provenance Attribution:** Correlates active AWS resources with their originating Terraform configuration and Git commit history.
- **Accountability:** Maps IAM identifiers to corporate identities for cost attribution.
- **Restoration:** Standardizes on non-destructive remediation actions (Stop/Detach) with automated state restoration support.

## Breaking Changes

- **JSON Schema:** The reporting output key `forensic_evidence` has been normalized to `audit_detail`.
