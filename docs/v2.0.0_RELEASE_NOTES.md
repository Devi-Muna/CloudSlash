# v2.0.0 Enterprise Standard

**Release Date:** January 13, 2026

## Executive Summary

CloudSlash v2.0.0 represents a complete maturation of the platform from a "developer tool" to an **Enterprise Infrastructure Audit Platform**. This release focuses on safety-critical workflows, executive visibility, and "Future-Glass" UX design.

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Safety-Critical Remediation

We have introduced a rigorous "Safety First" protocol for resource cleanup to prevent accidental data loss.

- **Safe Deletion (Default):** The new `safe_cleanup.sh` performs 'Soft Delete' operations (Stop Instance / Snapshot Volume) before removal.
- **Hard Termination:** Destructive actions are now separated into `resource_deletion.sh` and guarded by **Validation Required** warnings.
- **Interactive Confirmation:** The CLI now demands explicit confirmation before generating any destructive scripts.

### 2. Enterprise Visibility (Dashboard v2.0)

A complete visual overhaul of the reporting engine:

- **Financial Impact Analysis:** New Executive Summary includes "Monthly Burn Rate" and "Projected Annual Savings".
- **Strategic Categorization:** Waste is now broken down by vector (Compute vs. Storage vs. Network).
- **Future-Glass UI:** A new dark-mode interface with Chart.js visualization, interactive data grids, and responsive design.

### 3. The Autonomy Engine

- **Optimization Solver:** Utilizes Mixed-Integer Linear Programming models to determine optimal instance fleet composition.
- **Fragmentation Analysis:** Implements 2D Bin Packing algorithms to visualize cluster fragmentation.

## Breaking Changes

- **Command Renamed:** `nuke` has been replaced by `cleanup` to reflect the professional nature of the tool.
- **JSON Schema:** The reporting output key `forensic_evidence` has been normalized to `audit_detail`.
