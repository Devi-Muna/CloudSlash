# CloudSlash v2.0.0: The Autonomy Release

**Date:** January 12, 2026
**Codename:** "Self-Aware"

---

## 🚀 The Pivot: From Observability to Autonomy

CloudSlash v2.0 marks a fundamental shift in the product's philosophy. We are no longer just _finding_ waste; we are actively _solving_ infrastructure inefficiencies using advanced mathematical optimization.

This release bundles four major engine upgrades developed rapidly over the last sprint (formerly versioned internally as v1.3.x - v1.4.0).

## 💎 Key Features

### 1. The Autonomy Engine (New in v2.0)

- **The Solver**: A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) inspired optimizer that calculates the mathematically perfect instance fleet mix.
- **The Tetris Engine**: Visualizes Kubernetes fragmentation using 2D Bin Packing algorithms. It proves simply "resizing" isn't enough—you must "repack".
- **The Oracle**: A Bayesian Risk engine that tracks Spot Instance stability and "heals" its trust score over time.
- **Impact**: Automatically suggests migration plans (e.g., "Migrate 5x m5.large to 3x c6g.large") to save costs without risking stability.

### 2. The Provenance Engine ("Attribution")

- **Git Forensics**: Links every active AWS resource back to the specific Git commit and author that created it.
- **Terraform AST Parsing**: Analyzes your `main.tf` to pinpoint the exact line number of the resource definition.
- **Impact**: Changes the conversation from "Generic Technical Debt" to "Social Accountability".

### 3. The Accountability Engine

- **Identity Resolution**: Maps IAM Users and Git Authors to real corporate identities (Slack/Email).
- **Escalation**: Sends direct Slack notifications to the specific engineer responsible for the waste ("Hey [User], your rds-snapshot-123 is costing $50/mo").

### 4. The Lazarus Protocol ("Forgiving Delete")

- **Soft Deletion**: Instead of destroying resources immediately, it spins them down (Stop Instance / Detach Volume).
- **Drift-Based Restoration**: Generates Terraform import blocks to "resurrect" deleted resources if they are needed again.

## 🛡️ Enterprise Grade

- **Sanitized Terminology**: Removed all colloquialisms (e.g., "Zombie", "Nuke") in favor of professional industry standards ("Unused Resource", "Deletion Script").
- **Safety Policy**: "Asimov Constraints" prevent the Autonomy Engine from suggesting dangerous changes (e.g., >20% fleet churn).

## 📦 Installation

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DrSkyle/CloudSlash/main/dist/install.sh | bash
```

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **JSON Report**: Renamed `forensic_evidence` to `audit_detail` in `waste_report.json`.
- **CLI**: Renamed command output keys to match the new professional terminology.
