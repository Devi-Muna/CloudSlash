# CloudSlash v2.1.1 Release Notes

## Critical Fixes

- **Regional S3 Scanning**: Resolved `301 PermanentRedirect` errors when scanning S3 buckets located in regions different from the scanner's default region. The scanner now dynamically switches clients to match each bucket's specific location `(eu-central-1, us-west-2, etc.)` before performing data operations like inspecting Multipart Uploads.

## Improvements

- **Security Checksums**: Release artifacts now include a `SHA256SUMS` file for cryptographic verification of binaries.
- **Documentation**: Updated verification steps in `README.md`.

## How to Verify

Run `cloudslash --version` to ensure you are on `v2.1.1`.
