# Release Notes: v1.3.6

**Release Date:** Jan 11, 2026
**Type:** Feature Release

## Overview

Version 1.3.6 introduces a hierarchical Topology View for ECS resources and implements new waste detection heuristics for container infrastructure.

## New Features

### ECS Topology View

- Implemented a tree-based visualization for ECS resources (`Cluster -> Service -> Task`).
- Accessible via the `t` key in the TUI.
- Displays resource status and relationships in a hierarchical format.
- Uses standard alphanumeric indicators (`[C]`, `[S]`, `[I]`) for compatibility with all terminal emulators.

### ECS Waste Detection

Added new heuristic scanners to identify:

- **Idle Clusters**: Clusters with active EC2 instances but zero running tasks.
- **Empty Services**: Services with `DesiredCount > 0` but `RunningCount == 0` (indicating failure loops).
- **Broken Images**: Task definitions referencing missing ECR images.

### CI/CD Improvements

- Extended verification pipeline (`verify.yml`) to run on all `feature/*` branches.
- Enabled multi-platform build checks (Windows, Linux, macOS) for feature branches.

## Improvements

- **Performance**: Refactored internal Graph data structure to use slice-based storage (`[]Node`) instead of maps, improving memory efficiency for large topologies.
- **Stability**: Added global panic recovery middleware to prevent application crashes during heuristic execution.
- **Build System**: Standardized `Makefile` to use native Go toolchain commands.

## How to Update

Run the built-in update command:

```bash
cloudslash update
```
